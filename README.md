# Personal Website
### CST-120: Intro to Web Development
###### Introduction
This is an ongoing, semester long project in the Intro to Web Development class offered by Grand Canyon University. In this project I am currently developing a personal website with multiple pages, including a home page, contact page, about me page, and a top five lists page.
###### Coding Languages
* HTML - Structural development of pages
* CSS - Used to support variety of styles and animations in pages
* JavaScript - Will be used to further support styles, and also increase functionality of sit

###### Technologies
In this class we use visual studio to develop the website, and will eventually learn how to use various libraries, such as Bootstrap and jQuery to support more cosmetic options, as well as higher functionality of the website
