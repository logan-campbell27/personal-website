### CST-120: Intro to Web Development
###### Introduction
This is an ongoing, semester long project in the Intro to Web Development class offered by Grand Canyon University. In this project I am currently developing a personal website with multiple pages, including a home page, contact page, about me page, and a top five lists page.
